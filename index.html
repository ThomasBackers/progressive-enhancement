            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
                “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.” The farmer said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the horse came
                back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody
                came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
                events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
                riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
                “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next
                day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the
                army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
                the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he
                said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
                complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
                happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
                consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
                the consequences of good fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Good and Bad are just one perspective.
            Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys
            are not good for bananas. Let's not make a
            big deal out of it...
